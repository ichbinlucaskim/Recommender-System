# **What is LightGCN?**

  

> LightGCN (**Lightweight Graph Convolutional Network**) is a model for **collaborative filtering** that simplifies traditional GCNs to **focus purely on neighborhood aggregation**, no non-linearities, no weight matrices, just **embedding propagation through a user-item graph**.


## **Core Concepts**

Let’s assume:

- $\mathcal{U}$: set of users
    
- $\mathcal{I}$: set of items
    
- $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$: bipartite graph of users/items
    
- $\mathbf{e}_u^{(0)}, \mathbf{e}_i^{(0)}$: initial embeddings (randomly initialized)
    

The key idea:

> LightGCN refines embeddings by **aggregating information from neighbors** through multiple layers (hops).


# **Step-by-Step: How LightGCN Works**

## **Step 1: Initial Embeddings**

Every user u and item i has an initial embedding:

$\mathbf{e}_u^{(0)}, \quad \mathbf{e}_i^{(0)} \in \mathbb{R}^d$

These are trainable vectors — usually initialized randomly and updated during training.

## **Step 2: Neighborhood Aggregation (Propagation)**


At each layer k, LightGCN updates the embedding by **averaging the embeddings of neighboring nodes** from the previous layer:  

### **User embedding at layer** $k$**:**


$\mathbf{e}u^{(k)} = \sum{i \in \mathcal{N}_u} \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}_u|} \sqrt{|\mathcal{N}_i|}} \cdot \mathbf{e}_i^{(k-1)}$

- $\mathcal{N}_u$: set of items user u has interacted with
    
- The denominator is a **normalization term** (symmetric) to stabilize training
    
- You can think of this as:
    
    > “The user embedding becomes the average of the item embeddings it connects to”
    

  
### **Item embedding at layer** $k$**:**


$\mathbf{e}i^{(k)} = \sum{u \in \mathcal{N}_i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}_i|} \sqrt{|\mathcal{N}_u|}} \cdot \mathbf{e}_u^{(k-1)}$

Same logic, just reversed for item side.


## **Step 3: Final Embedding (Layer Combination)**


After K propagation steps, the **final embedding** for a user or item is the **average of all layer outputs**:


$\mathbf{e}u = \frac{1}{K+1} \sum{k=0}^{K} \mathbf{e}_u^{(k)} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{e}i = \frac{1}{K+1} \sum{k=0}^{K} \mathbf{e}_i^{(k)}$


This means:

- You keep the original embedding $\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$
    
- Plus embeddings from each propagation layer
    
- And average them for stability + rich structure


## **Step 4: Rating Prediction (Scoring)**


Once you have final embeddings for user u and item i, you compute how well they match using the **dot product**:
  

$\hat{y}_{u,i} = \mathbf{e}_u^\top \mathbf{e}_i$

- A higher value means **user** u is more likely to prefer **item** $i$


## **Loss Function**


LightGCN usually uses the **BPR Loss (Bayesian Personalized Ranking)** to optimize for ranking:


$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{(u, i, j)} \ln \sigma(\hat{y}{u,i} - \hat{y}{u,j}) + \lambda ||\Theta||^2$

  

Where:

- $i$: a positive item user u interacted with
    
- $j$: a negative item user u didn’t interact with
    
- $\sigma$: sigmoid function
    
- $\lambda ||\Theta||^2$: regularization
    

This encourages the model to rank **positive items higher than negative ones** for each user.
