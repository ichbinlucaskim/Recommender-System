# Matrix Factorization


Matrix Factorization (MF) is a recommendation technique that goes beyond surface-level **correlations between users and items** and instead seeks to uncover the **latent (hidden) factors** that drive user preferences and item characteristics.


### **1. Beyond Correlation → Into Structure**

-  Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF):

→ “People who liked the same things in the past will like similar things in the future.”

→ Based on **direct co-occurrence or similarity** between users/items.

-  Matrix Factorization:

→ “Let’s learn **why** a user likes something by identifying hidden factors that represent their preferences and the item’s properties.”

→ Models the **underlying structure** behind the ratings.

### **2. Latent Factors (Hidden Dimensions)**

-  Every **user** is represented as a vector that reflects their **preferences** (e.g., action vs. drama, emotional vs. lighthearted).

-  Every **item** is represented as a vector that reflects its **attributes** (e.g., genre intensity, tone, complexity).

-  The **dot product** of these two vectors predicts how much the user will like the item.

### 3. Why it works

|**Problem**|**MF Solution**|
|---|---|
|Sparse data (most ratings are missing)|Learns from patterns in partial data|
|No explicit item features|Infers them automatically from user behavior|
|Generalization|Can recommend items a user has never seen, based on latent preference match|

### **4. Interpretability & Power**

-  MF turns recommendation into a **matching problem in a latent space**.

-  Instead of just saying “you liked what others liked,” it says:

→ “**You like these hidden traits, and this item has them.**”
